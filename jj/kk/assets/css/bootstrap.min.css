/**
 * Bootstrap v5.3.0 (https://getbootstrap.com/)
 * 
 * This is a placeholder file. In a production environment, you should:
 * 1. Either include the full Bootstrap CSS from a CDN:
 *    <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.0/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
 * 
 * 2. Or download the full minified version from:
 *    https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/download/
 * 
 * The actual Bootstrap CSS file is too large to include here in full.
