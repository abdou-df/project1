/**
 * Font Awesome 6.4.0 (https://fontawesome.com)
 * 
 * This is a placeholder file. In a production environment, you should:
 * 1. Either include Font Awesome CSS from a CDN:
 *    <link href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/6.4.0/css/all.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
 * 
 * 2. Or download the full minified version from:
 *    https://fontawesome.com/download
 * 
 * The actual Font Awesome CSS file is too large to include here in full.
