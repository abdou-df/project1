/**
 * Chart.js v4.3.0 (https://www.chartjs.org/)
 * 
 * This is a placeholder file. In a production environment, you should:
 * 1. Either include Chart.js from a CDN:
 *    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chart.js@4.3.0/dist/chart.umd.min.js"></script>
 * 
 * 2. Or download the full minified version from:
 *    https://github.com/chartjs/Chart.js/releases
 * 
 * The actual Chart.js library is too large to include here in full.
