/**
 * jQuery v3.7.0 (https://jquery.com/)
 * 
 * This is a placeholder file. In a production environment, you should:
 * 1. Either include jQuery from a CDN:
 *    <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.7.0.min.js"></script>
 * 
 * 2. Or download the full minified version from:
 *    https://jquery.com/download/
 * 
 * The actual jQuery library is too large to include here in full.
